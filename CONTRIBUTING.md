# Contributing

## The Basics
In order for you to contribute to OpenBlocks, you will need:

- A GitHub account
- A fork of OpenBlocks

## Code Requirements
We are loose when it comes to coding style. However, to help keep code consistent between all contributors, we ask that you follow the [Oracle Coding Convention](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/codeconvtoc-136057.html) as closely as possible.

## What To Contribute
When joining an open source project, I often don't know where to begin. Here are some things you can work on:

- Fix or open [issues](https://github.com/mattrick16/OpenBlocks/issues).
- Join our IRC chat
- Visit the forums
- Fix TODO's


Thank you for helping us!
